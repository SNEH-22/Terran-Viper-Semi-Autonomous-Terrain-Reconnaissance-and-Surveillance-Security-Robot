## 🌟 Why Terran Viper?  
Reconnaissance in **hostile terrains** is critical for **defense, disaster management, industrial inspections, and wildlife monitoring**. Terran Viper addresses this need by combining:  
- **Snake-inspired motion** (serpentine, rectilinear, sidewinding) for extreme mobility.  
- **Dual-mode communication** (RS485 wired, LoRa wireless) for reliable, long-range operations.  
- **AI-powered depth estimation** and **voxel-based 3D mapping** for situational awareness.

## 🔑 Key Highlights
- **Bio-inspired robotics:** Designed after real snake locomotion mechanisms.  
- **Multimodal locomotion:** Serpentine (smooth crawling), rectilinear (inchworm-like), and sidewinding (desert traversal).  
- **Advanced communication:**  
  - 🛰️ **LoRa wireless** → 300m range, low-power transmission.  
  - 🔌 **RS485 wired** → 1.2 km stable connection + retrieval capability.  
- **Real-time surveillance:**  
  - ESP32-CAM + ArduCAM for live video streaming.  
  - Depth estimation using **MiDaS, Monodepth2**.  
  - 3D voxel cloud generation with **OpenCV, PyTorch, Open3D**.  
- **Mechanical design:** CAD-modeled modular joints with yaw/pitch control, powered by **MG995 servos**.  
- **Energy system:** 8x 18650 Li-ion batteries (11–12 Ah, 1–2 hr runtime).  
- **Applications:** Military, NDRF, industrial inspection, wildlife monitoring.
